# SignUp-Page-Express.js-API
A SignUp page created using Express.js which uses mailchimp API to store the names and email address in their database.
Here I first created a basic sign up page for my newsletter website which was designed using bootstrap to give the website a proffessional look.
Then i used the NPM package manager which are available for Node js at the backend to create my server at the local host 3000.
I used the Mailchimp api to store my data inside the database which would be stored at the mailchimp database whenever any one would be entering his login credentials into my login page.
We can view the people who have subscribed to our newsletter from the mailchimp application.
We  can go to the analytics-audience-My contacts from where we would get the data of all the people who have come on our website and entered their login credentials.
